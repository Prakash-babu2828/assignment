The construction of the fort dates back to the 12th century when the city of Kurnool was used as a base on Tungabhadra river crossing. Kurnool was occupied by Vijayanagara ruler Devaraya II and Achyutaraya who succeeded Krishnadevaraya built the initial fort between 1530 and 1542.

The fort has different gateways and bastions. The gateways of the fort were constructed by Gopala Raja, the grandson of Rama Raja of Talikota Vijayanagara kings in the 17th century.

The fort is named after Konda Reddy, the last ruler of Alampur who was imprisoned in the fort by the Kurnool Nawab in the 17th century. Locals and legend state that Konda Reddy was under attack, and used the tunnels that the fort housed to escape. Konda Reddy eventually escaped from the fort, but had to loose his territory to Golconda Nawabs.[3] The tunnels are now locked and closed off from the public, but the fort is open to touring.
